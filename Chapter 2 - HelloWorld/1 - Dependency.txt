To use Thymeleaf in your Spring Boot project, you need to include the Thymeleaf dependency in your project's build configuration.

If you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency>

If you are using Gradle, you can add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf'

After adding the dependency, you need to rebuild your project or let your build tool resolve the new dependency.

Once the Thymeleaf dependency is added, Spring Boot will automatically configure Thymeleaf as the default template engine and look for Thymeleaf templates in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory.

You can then create your Thymeleaf templates with the `.html` extension in the `templates` directory and start using Thymeleaf's features for dynamic rendering of data in your views.
