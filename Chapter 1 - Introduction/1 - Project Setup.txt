Certainly! Below are the step-by-step instructions to set up a complete Java Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializer web-based project initializer.

1. Open your web browser and go to the Spring Initializer website
https://start.spring.io/

2. Fill in the project details:

   - Project: Select "Maven Project" or "Gradle Project" based on your preference.

   - Language: Choose "Java".

   - Spring Boot: Select the desired version.

   - Group: Enter your project's group identifier (e.g., com.example).

   - Artifact: Provide your project's artifact identifier (e.g., myproject).

   - Name: Enter a name for your project.

   - Description: Optionally, provide a brief description for your project.

   - Package Name: Specify the base package name for your project (e.g., com.example.myproject).

   - Packaging: Choose "Jar" or "War" based on your needs.

   - Java: Select the desired Java version.
   
3. Select Dependencies:

   - In the search bar, type "Spring Web" and select the "Spring Web" dependency.

   - If you plan to use a database, search for and select the appropriate database dependency 
   (e.g., "Spring Data JPA" for using a relational database).

   - Add any other required dependencies for your project.

4. Click the "Generate" button to download a zip file containing the project structure.

5. Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory of your choice.

6. Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).

7. Import the project into your IDE:
   - In IntelliJ IDEA: Select "Import Project," navigate to the extracted project directory, and select the `pom.xml` file (if using Maven) or `build.gradle` file (if using Gradle).
   - In Eclipse: Select "Import" -> "Existing Gradle/Maven Projects," navigate to the extracted project directory, and select the `pom.xml` file (if using Maven) or `build.gradle` file (if using Gradle).
   - In Visual Studio Code: Open the extracted project directory with Visual Studio Code.

8. Once the project is imported, you can proceed to create the Country model, migration script, and REST controller as described in the previous answer.

9. Run the application:
   - In IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, locate the main class (typically named `Application` or `MyProjectApplication`) and run it.
   - In Visual Studio Code, open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and execute the command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (if using Maven) or `./gradlew bootRun` (if using Gradle).

10. Your Spring Boot application should now be running. You can test the REST API endpoints using a tool like Postman or by accessing them directly in your web browser.

That's it! You've successfully set up a Java Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializer and can now start developing your web application.
